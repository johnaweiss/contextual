# contextual
A proposal for a new programming language, or meta-language, designed for radical brevity plus human-readability. 

Contextual is in the **brainstorming phase.** The only object right now is for the community to dream up better ways to write code. No work will be done on a parser, transpiler, or compiler at this time. 

The github wiki will be the design document for this project.
